### Word Representations

1. G. E. Hinton, J. L, McClelland, and D. E. Rumelhart. [Distributed representations](https://web.stanford.edu/~jlmcc/papers/PDP/Chapter3.pdf). In D. E. Rumelhart and J. L. McClelland, Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition. Volume 1: Foundations, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA. 1986. The related slides are [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~bonner/courses/2014s/csc321/lectures/lec5.pdf) or [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~bonner/courses/2016s/csc321/lectures/extra/coarse.pdf).
   * "Distributed representation" means a many-tomany relationship between two types of representation (such as concepts and neurons): 1. Each concept is represented by many
   neurons; 2. Each neuron participates in the representation of many concepts.
2. [Language Modeling with N-Grams](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/4.pdf). The related slides are [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/slides/LM_4.pptx). It introduced language modeling and the N-gram, one of the most widely used tools in language processing.
   * Language models offer a way to assign a probability to a sentence or other sequence of words, and to predict a word from preceding words.
   * N-grams are Markov models that estimate words from a fixed window of previous words. N-gram probabilities can be estimated by counting in a corpus and normalizing (the maximum likelihood estimate).
   * N-gram language models are evaluated extrinsically in some task, or intrinsically using perplexity.
   * The perplexity of a test set according to a language model is the geometric mean of the inverse test set probability computed by the model.
   * Smoothing algorithms provide a more sophisticated way to estimat the probability of N-grams. Commonly used smoothing algorithms for N-grams rely on lower-order N-gram counts through backoff or interpolation.
   * There are at least two drawbacks for the n-gram language model. First, it is not taking into account contexts farther than 1 or 2 words. N-grams with n up to 5 (i.e. 4 words of context) have been reported, though, but due to data scarcity, most predictions are made with a much shorter context. Second, it is not taking into account the “similarity” between words. 
3. Yoshua Bengio, Réjean Ducharme, Pascal Vincent and Christian Jauvin. [A Neural Probabilistic Language Model](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf). Journal of Machine Learning Research, 2003.
   - They propose continuous space LMs using neural networks to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words.
   - The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations.
   - Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence.
   - The idea of the proposed approach can be summarized: 1. associate with each word in the vocabulary a distributed word feature vector, 2. express the joint probability function of word sequences in terms of the feature vectors of these words in the sequence, and 3. learn simultaneously the word feature vectors and the parameters of that probability function.
4. In the following two papers, it is shown that both to project all words of the context onto a continuous space and calculate the language model probability for the given context can be performed by a neural network using two hidden layers.
   * Holger Schwenk and Jean-Luc Gauvain. [Training Neural Network Language Models On Very Large Corpora](ftp://tlp.limsi.fr/public/emnlp05.pdf). in Proc. Joint Conference HLT/EMNLP, 2005.
   * Holger Schwenk. [Continuous space language models](https://wiki.inf.ed.ac.uk/twiki/pub/CSTR/ListenSemester2_2009_10/sdarticle.pdf). Computer Speech and Language, 2007.
5. Tomas Mikolov's series of papers improved the quality of word representations:
   * T. Mikolov, J. Kopecky, L. Burget, O. Glembek and J. Cernocky. [Neural network based language models for higly inflective languages](http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/research/groups/speech/publi/2009/mikolov_ic2009_nnlm_4.pdf). Proc. ICASSP, 2009. The first step in their architecture is training of bigram neural network: given word w from vocabulary V, estimate probability distribution of the next word in text. To compute projection of word w onto a  continuous space, half of the bigram network (first two layers) is used to compute values in hidden layer. Values from the hidden layer of bigram network are used to form input layer of n-gram network.
   * T. Mikolov, W.T. Yih and G. Zweig. [Linguistic Regularities in Continuous Space Word Representations](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N13-1090). NAACL HLT, 2013. They examine the vector-space word representations that are implicitly learned by the input-layer weights. They find that these representations are surprisingly good at capturing syntactic and semantic regularities in language, and that each relationship is characterized by a relation-specific vector offset. This allows vector-oriented reasoning based on the offsets between words. Remarkably, this method outperforms the best previous systems.
   * Tomas Mikolov, Kai Chen, Greg Corrado and Jeffrey Dean. [Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781v3). arXiv:1301.3781v3, 2013. They propose two new model architectures for learning distributed representations: 1. Continuous Bag-of-Words Model (CBOW) builds a log-linear classifier with context words at the input, where the training criterion is to correctly classify the current word; 2. Continuous Skip-gram Model uses each current word as an input to a log-linear classifier with continuous projection layer, and predicts words within a certain range before and after the current word.
   * Tomas Mikolov, Ilya Sutskever, Kai Chen, Greg Corrado and Jeffrey Dean. [Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4546). arXiv:1310.4546, 2013. The source code written in C is [word2vec](https://github.com/tmikolov/word2vec). They present several extensions of the original Skip-gram model. They show that sub-sampling of frequent words during training results in a significant speedup (around 2x - 10x), and improves accuracy of the representations of less frequent words. In addition, they present a simplified variant of Noise Contrastive Estimation for training the Skip-gram model that results in faster training and better vector representations for frequent words. Word based model is extended to phrase based model. They found that simple vector addition can often produce meaningful results.
   * Tomas Mikolov, Edouard Grave, Piotr Bojanowski, Christian Puhrsch and Armand Joulin.[Advances in Pre-Training Distributed Word Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09405). arXiv:1712.09405, 2017. They show that several modifications of the standard word2vec training pipeline significantly improves the quality of the resulting word vectors: position-dependent weighting, the phrase representations and the subword information.

Why do Semantic Relations correspond to Directions?
   * The blog [Linear algebraic structure of word meanings](http://www.offconvex.org/2016/07/10/embeddingspolysemy/) introduces the main result about [Linear Algebraic Structure of Word Senses, with Applications to Polysemy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03764), which shows that word senses are easily accessible in many current word embeddings.

    * Could context-dependent relationships be recovered from word embeddings? To address this issue, they introduce a powerful, domain-general solution: "semantic projection" of word-vectors onto lines that represent various object features, like size (the line extending from the word "small" to "big"), intelligence (from "dumb" to "smart"), or danger (from "safe" to "dangerous").

    * While one of the first steps in many NLP systems is selecting what embeddings to use, they argue that such a step is better left for neural networks to figure out by themselves. To that end, they introduce a novel, straightforward yet highly effective method for combining multiple types of word embeddings in a single model, leading to state-of-the-art performance within the same model class on a variety of tasks.

The paragraph vector and word vectors are averaged or concatenated to predict the next word in a context. The contexts are fixed-length and sampled from a sliding window over the paragraph. The paragraph vector is shared across all contexts generated from the same paragraph but not across paragraphs. However, the word vector matrix is shared across paragraphs. The downside is at prediction time, inference needs to be performed to compute a new vector.
   * Distributed Bag of Words version of Paragraph Vector (PV-DBOW): This modle is to ignore the context words in the input, but force the model to predict words randomly sampled from the paragraph in the output.

The source code in Python is [skip-thoughts](https://github.com/ryankiros/skip-thoughts). The TensorFlow implementation of *Skip-Thought Vectors* is [skip_thoughts](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/skip_thoughts)
   * Instead of using a word to predict its surrounding context, they instead encode a sentence to predict the sentences around it. The skip-thoughts is in the framework of encoder-decoder models: an encoder maps words to a sentence vector and a decoder is used to generate the surrounding sentences.
   * The end product of skip-thoughts is the encoder,  which can then be used to generate fixed length representations of sentences. The decoders are thrown away after training.
   * A good tutorial to this paper is [My Thoughts On Skip Thoughts](http://sanyam5.github.io/my-thoughts-on-skip-thoughts/).

   * They present two approaches that use unlabeled data to improve sequence learning with recurrent networks. The first approach is to predict what comes next in a sequence, which is a conventional language model in natural language processing. The second approach is to use a sequence autoencoder, which reads the input sequence into a vector and predicts the input sequence again. These two algorithms can be used as a "pretraining" step for a later supervised sequence learning algorithm.
   * Their semi-supervised learning approach is related to Skip-Thought vectors with two differences. The first difference is that Skip-Thought is a harder objective, because it predicts adjacent sentences. The second is that Skip-Thought is a pure unsupervised learning algorithm, without fine-tuning.

   * A weighted average of words by their distance from the first principal component of a sentence is proposed, which  yields a remarkably robust approximate sentence vector embedding.
   * However, this “smooth inverse frequency” approach comes with limitations. Not only is calculating PCA for every sentence in a document computationally complex, but the first principal component of a small number of normally distributed words in a high dimensional space is subject to random fluctuation. Their calculation of word frequencies from the unigram count of the word in the corpus also means that their approach still does not work for out-of-vocab words, has no equivalent in other vector spaces and can’t be generated from the word vectors alone.

   * To address the lack of labeled data and to make NLP classification easier and less time-consuming, the researchers suggest applying transfer learning to NLP problems. Thus, instead of training the model from scratch, you can use another model that has been trained to solve a similar problem as the basis, and then fine-tune the original model to solve your specific problem.
   * This fine-tuning should take into account several important considerations: a) Different layers should be fine-tuned to different extents as they capture different kinds of information. b) Adapting model’s parameters to task-specific features will be more efficient if the learning rate is firstly linearly increased and then linearly decayed. c) Fine-tuning all layers at once is likely to result in catastrophic forgetting; thus, it would be better to gradually unfreeze the model starting from the last layer.
   * ULMFiT consists of three stages: a) The LM is trained on a general-domain corpus to capture general features of the language in different layers. b) The full LM is fine-tuned on target task data using discriminative fine-tuning and slanted triangular learning rates to learn task-specific features. c) The classifier is fine-tuned on the target task using gradual unfreezing and STLR to preserve low-level representations and adapt high-level ones.

### Extractive Text Summarization

1. H. P. Luhn. [The automatic creation of literature abstracts](http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i256/f06/papers/luhn58.pdf). IBM Journal of Research and Development, 1958. Luhn's method is as follows:
   1. Ignore Stopwords: Common words (known as stopwords) are ignored.
   2. Determine Top Words: The most often occuring words in the document are counted up.
   3. Select Top Words: A small number of the top words are selected to be used for scoring.
   4. Select Top Sentences: Sentences are scored according to how many of the top words they contain. The top four sentences are selected for the summary.

The source code in Python is [sklearn.decomposition.LatentDirichletAllocation](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/auto_examples/applications/plot_topics_extraction_with_nmf_lda.html). Reimplement Luhn's algorithm, but with topics instead of words and applied to several documents instead of one.
   1. Train LDA on all products of a certain type (e.g. all the books)
   2. Treat all the reviews of a particular product as one document, and infer their topic distribution
   3. Infer the topic distribution for each sentence
   4. For each topic that dominates the reviews of a product, pick some sentences that are themselves dominated by that topic.

The source code in Python is [pytextrank](https://github.com/ceteri/pytextrank). `pytextrank` works in four stages, each feeding its output to the next:
   - Part-of-Speech Tagging and lemmatization are performed for every sentence in the document.
   - Key phrases are extracted along with their counts, and are normalized.
   - Calculates a score for each sentence by approximating jaccard distance between the sentence and key phrases.
   - Summarizes the document based on most significant sentences and key phrases.

[Variations of the Similarity Function of TextRank for Automated Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03606). arXiv:1602.03606, 2016. The source code in Python is [gensim.summarization](http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/). Gensim's summarization only works for English for now, because the text is pre-processed so that stop words are removed and the words are stemmed, and these processes are language-dependent. TextRank works as follows:
   - Pre-process the text: remove stop words and stem the remaining words.
   - Create a graph where vertices are sentences.
   - Connect every sentence to every other sentence by an edge. The weight of the edge is how similar the two sentences are.
   - Run the PageRank algorithm on the graph.
   - Pick the vertices(sentences) with the highest PageRank score.
7. [TextTeaser](https://github.com/MojoJolo/textteaser) uses basic summarization features and build from it. Those features are:
   - Title feature is used to score the sentence with the regards to the title. It is calculated as the count of words which are common to title of the document and sentence.
   - Sentence length is scored depends on how many words are in the sentence. TextTeaser defined a constant “ideal” (with value 20), which represents the ideal length of the summary, in terms of number of words. Sentence length is calculated as a normalized distance from this value.
   - Sentence position is where the sentence is located. I learned that introduction and conclusion will have higher score for this feature.
   - Keyword frequency is just the frequency of the words used in the whole text in the bag-of-words model (after removing stop words).

   - LexRank uses IDF-modified Cosine as the similarity measure between two sentences. This similarity is used as weight of the graph edge between two sentences. LexRank also incorporates an intelligent post-processing step which makes sure that top sentences chosen for the summary are not too similar to each other.

### Abstractive Text Summarization

1. Alexander M. Rush, Sumit Chopra, Jason Weston. [A Neural Attention Model for Abstractive Sentence Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00685). EMNLP, 2015. The source code in LUA Torch7 is [NAMAS](https://github.com/facebook/NAMAS).
   - They use sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder LSTM with attention.
   - They use the first sentence of a document. The source document is quite small (about 1 paragraph or ~500 words in the training dataset of Gigaword) and the produced output is also very short (about 75 characters). It remains an open challenge to scale up these limits - to produce longer summaries over multi-paragraph text input (even good LSTM models with attention models fall victim to vanishing gradients when the input sequences become longer than a few hundred items).
   - The evaluation method used for automatic summarization has traditionally been the ROUGE metric - which has been shown to correlate well with human judgment of summary quality, but also has a known tendency to encourage "extractive" summarization - so that using ROUGE as a target metric to optimize will lead a summarizer towards a copy-paste behavior of the input instead of the hoped-for reformulation type of summaries.
2. Peter Liu and Xin Pan. [Sequence-to-Sequence with Attention Model for Text Summarization](https://research.googleblog.com/2016/08/text-summarization-with-tensorflow.html). 2016. The source code in Python is [textsum](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/textsum).
   - They use sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder LSTM with attention and bidirectional neural net.
   - They use the first 2 sentences of a document with a limit at 120 words.
   - The scores achieved by Google’s *textsum* are 42.57 ROUGE-1 and 23.13 ROUGE-2.

[Abstractive Text Summarization Using Sequence-to-Sequence RNNs and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06023). arXiv:1602.06023, 2016. The souce code written in Python is [Summarization](https://github.com/zwc12/Summarization) or [abstractive-text-summarization](https://github.com/alesee/abstractive-text-summarization).
   - They use GRU with attention and bidirectional neural net.
   - They use the first 2 sentences of a documnet with a limit at 120 words.
   - They use the [Large vocabulary trick (LVT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2007) of Jean et al. 2014, which means when you decode, use only the words that appear in the source - this reduces perplexity. But then you lose the capability to do "abstractive" summary. So they do "vocabulary expansion" by adding a layer of "word2vec nearest neighbors" to the words in the input.
   - Feature rich encoding - they add TFIDF and Named Entity types to the word embeddings (concatenated) to the encodings of the words - this adds to the encoding dimensions that reflect "importance" of the words. 
   - The most interesting of all is what they call the "Switching Generator/Pointer" layer. In the decoder, they add a layer that decides to either generate a new word based on the context / previously generated word (usual decoder) or copy a word from the input (that is - add a pointer to the input). They learn when to do Generate vs. Pointer and when it is a Pointer which word of the input to Point to.

    - They addressed an important problem in sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) learning referred to as copying, in which certain segments in the input sequence are selectively replicated in the output sequence. In this paper, they incorporated copying into neural network-based Seq2Seq learning and propose a new model called CopyNet with encoder-decoder structure. CopyNet can nicely integrate the regular way of word generation in the decoder with the new copying mechanism which can choose sub-sequences in the input sequence and put them at proper places in the output sequence.

2. Baotian Hu, Qingcai Chen and Fangze Zhu. [LCSTS: A Large Scale Chinese Short Text Summarization Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05865). 2015.
   - They constructed a large-scale Chinese short text summarization dataset constructed from the Chinese microblogging website Sina Weibo, which is released to [the public](http://icrc.hitsz.edu.cn/Article/show/139.html). Then they performed GRU-based encoder-decoder method on it to generate summary. They took the whole short text as one sequence, this may not be very reasonable, because most of short texts contain several sentences.
   - LCSTS contains 2,400,591 (short text, summary) pairs as the training set and 1,106  pairs as the test set.
   - All the models are trained on the GPUs tesla M2090 for about one week.
   - The results show that the RNN with context outperforms RNN without context on both character and word based input.
   - Moreover, the performances of the character-based input outperform the word-based input.

It works by comparing an automatically produced summary or translation against a set of reference summaries (typically human-produced).  ROUGE is one of the standard ways to compute effectiveness of auto generated summaries. The evaluation toolkit [ROUGE 2.0](https://github.com/RxNLP/ROUGE-2.0) is an easy to use  for Automatic Summarization tasks.
